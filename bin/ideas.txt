Buttons Layout:

one horizontal toolbar:

new, open, save, zoom, zoom all, zoom region, geometry, mesh, physics, solve, postproc, select only lines, select only points, select only geom. partitions, select only phys. regions

one vertical bar:

geometry context (geometry written on some label down the bottom of the window)
new coordsys
edit coordsys
new point
edit point
new segment
new arc
new complex line
edit line
detect partitions
transfomation (to be renamed)


# -------------------------------- #
All the coordinate systems, either local or global, are defined versus the
upper left corner of the canvas (0, 0 in pixel coordinates).
All the points are defined versus the upper left corner of the canvas.
____________________________________
Why? 
Future methods like zoom and translate don't have to use the pixel origin of the coordinate system to compute the new position (pixels) of the points and coordinates. From this point of view (the pixel coordinates are versus the upper left corner - or the global graphical coordonate system - ggcs), the full implementation of these method should be straight forward.
