TODOs

================================================================================
In order to advance to version 0.0.0b of the software the following must be done:

1) Rewrite the Menu custom class in order to:
    - suport subdirectories (xml file definition must be modified also)
    - hopefully have a clear syntax
    - have __doc__ attributes
    - support icons
    - support accelerators
    - support separators
    - support default disableed items (or this option to be read from somewhere else)
    - add appropriate try ... except blocks

2) Modify the callbacks from GUI.callbacks.geometry (for now .csys and .point) to
   draw those entities on the DrawingArea:
   - start with the csys callback (maybe solve (3) here also)
   - add the other fields to the windows

3) Modify the appropriate callbacks and xml definition in order to include csys
   definition in the xml files. Appropriate callback - newProject (writes the 
   global coordinate system definition in the newly created *geometry.xml file),
   openProject (to load it in the data tree of the DrawingArea object), save and
   saveAsProject, etc.

4) Revisit all the xml definitions and write their DTD's

5) Add the left toolbox - it should offer means to create coordinate systems 
   and points by now

The TODOs required to advance to 0.0.0c will be written above these ones. The 
version 0.0.1 is intended to have features like displaying points, lines and 
detect surfaces, translating and zooming the whole thing
