TODOs

================================================================================
In order to advance to version 0.0.0b of the software the following must be done:

1) Rewrite the Menu custom class in order to:
    - suport subdirectories (xml file definition must be modified also)
    - have a clear syntax
    - have __doc__ attributes

2) Modify the callbacks from GUI.callbacks.geometry (newCSys & newPoint) to
   draw those entities on the DrawingArea

3) Modify the appropriate callbacks and xml definition in order to include csys
   definition in the xml files

4) Revisit all the xml definitions and write their DTD's

5) Add the left toolbox - it should offer means to create coordinate systems 
   and points by now
