TODOs

================================================================================
In order to advance to version 0.0.0b of the software the following must be done:

1) Rewrite the Menu custom class in order to:
    - suport subdirectories (xml file definition must be modified also)
    - have a clear syntax
    - have __doc__ attributes
    - support icons
    - support default grayed conditions (or to be read from somewhere else)

2) Modify the callbacks from GUI.callbacks.geometry (newCSys & newPoint) to
   draw those entities on the DrawingArea - this is some work to be done and extra
   details must be added.

3) Modify the appropriate callbacks and xml definition in order to include csys
   definition in the xml files. Appropriate callback - newProject (writes the 
   global coordinate system definition in the newly created *geometry.xml file),
   openProject (to load it in the data tree of the DrawingArea object), save and
   saveAsProject, etc.

4) Revisit all the xml definitions and write their DTD's

5) Add the left toolbox - it should offer means to create coordinate systems 
   and points by now
