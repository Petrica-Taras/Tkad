State of development
=======================

Please note that for now the software is a mess and - it hasn't the slightest functionality added. 

Overview
=======================

This project is intended to be a 2D physical framework used to prototype ideas.

Dependencies
=======================

Tkinter + Tix - these, as far as I know is delivered with Python for major OSes. 

NetworkX - this isn't included for now in the software but it will be added later when the surface support is added

Usage
=======================

Fire tkad.py from the Tkad directory
