Tkad 

Please note that for now the software is a mess and - it hasn't the slightest functionality added. 

Overview
=======================

This project is intended to be a 2D physical framework used to prototype ideas.
More exact - it will contain meanings for drawing your computation domain, physical scenarios, symbolic calculations, solvers and to provide you with the appropriate tools to postprocess your results. For instance the first thing I want to do is to do some particle collision test.
Note that some of the parts (solvers, mesh generators) I don't intend to write myself but to borrow from somewhere else if they are under the proper copyright licence.

Dependencies
=======================

Python 2.7 - Tkad is a bunch of Python scripts running on top of Python 2.7. Tkad doesn't need compilation nor installation and will not run without preinstalled Python (2.7)

Tkinter - this, as far as I know is delivered with Python for major OSes. Tkinter is not the proper tool for this job since it is lacking some common widgets suport (especially for Python 2.7) and I believe a 3D feature of the software won't be possible because of Tkinter. Nevertheless if the software reaches an advanced stage of development I am willing to either port the GUI part to pyGTK or something like that or to fully port the entire software in C using GTK 3 as a graphical toolkit.

NetworkX - this isn't included for now in the software but it will be used due to its graph algorithm and data structures

Various dependencies - to add as the development progres ...

Software Structure
=======================

I intend to fully detail the software structure in the folder "management" using a chart (you'll have to have a software like freemind to be able to us it).
