State of development
=======================

Most of the widgets are in position. Most of the logic behind is missing since the Tkinter based UI was dumped and wxPython was adopted (along with a better structuring of the code).

Overview
=======================

This project is intended to be a framework used to prototype ideas.

Dependencies
=======================

wxPython (used to be Tkinter and Tix) - for GUI - this limits the python version to 2.x

NetworkX - this isn't included for now in the software but it will be added later when the surface support is added

Usage
=======================

Fire tkad.py from the Tkad directory
